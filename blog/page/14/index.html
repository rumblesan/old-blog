  <div class="entry-content"><p>So the other week I started getting a bit burnt out on music and decided a change was in order, at least for a while. So I went and started playing around with my friend <a href="http://povray.org/">PovRay</a> again, a free ray tracing program.</p>

<p>After getting to grips with it and realising that, thanks to a lot of new maths knowledge since I last used it 5 or so years ago, it was an awful lot of fun. The only issue is that I very quickly started creating images that took quite a while to render. This event quite happily coincided with my finding a source of surprisingly cheap rack-mount servers so I decided that the obvious thing to do would be to make a render farm!!</p>

<p>I realise that this is perhaps overkill, and the answer is really to just make images at smaller resolutions and put up with the time it takes, but I like the idea of having a big bank of servers that are my own, and if I want to do animations (which I do, more on this later) then a bank of servers is a good investment.</p>

<p>The plan is now very much in motion and sitting on the coffee table in front of me I have 5 2U rack mount servers, each with an AMD64 3000+ CPU and a gig of RAM. Not the highest spec machines but cheap and useful. These are now encased in a nice 10U ABS plastic rack case and looking very swish. After some failed attempts to install Ubuntu Server on them the other night (Always MD5 check your ISO files, or at least the important ones) I’ll be re attempting later today. I also have a LinkSys WRT54G router with the open <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/site/index">DD-WRT</a> firmware. this will be used to hook the cluster up to my home network with some <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Client_Mode_Wireless">client mode</a> magic.</p>

<p>Ideally I’d like to have another box to sit on the subnet with the cluster to act as a master task giver and file storage area but I’ve not yet found a suitable device for a cheap price. I may well pick-up a broken net-book soonish however.</p>

<p>As far as how I’m going to split the tasks up, there’s really not going to be much magic. Povray can be run via the command line and has the useful ability to only render part of an image.
This means that a simple python script can SCP the .POV files over to each node in the cluster, get them to render a section, SCP the section of the image back and put the image together once all the pieces are done. With animations the process is even simpler because individual frames can be rendered by each machine, meaning the script doesn’t have to go about splitting and joining images.</p>

<p>Python scripting will start properly next week, for the moment I’ll just have my work cut out for me getting Ubuntu installed and checking all the servers work. Unfortunately in the process of delivery, DHL gave the package a hefty bump and some of the cases were warped where the handles on the front dented. A bit annoying but not too much of an issue.</p>

<p>As you can see, everything looks fine from the front.</p>

<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_AvMGnA-mpis/S3_oNkSbkbI/AAAAAAAAACE/--OINm3r71c/s1600-h/DSCN4739.JPG"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_AvMGnA-mpis/S3_oNkSbkbI/AAAAAAAAACE/--OINm3r71c/s400/DSCN4739.JPG" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>The bits of tape on the front are the node names, Horse-Head, Crab, Eagle, Pelican and Tarantula. In keeping with my Star themed network naming convention I named them all after different nebulae. It seemed appropriate.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So the touch sequencer is finally at that point where I feel it’s ready to release. Obviously it’s been available all this time but now I’m actually going to start poking people about it.</p>

<p>The GUI is still ugly, but that should just take an evening with Paint Shop Pro and a few “How to make nice buttons” tutorials off the web.</p>

<p>So, a brief feature run down</p>

<p>Both CC Curve and Grid channels</p>

<p>Grids come in 8<em>16 and 16</em>32 flavours.
Each can be configured to have an automatic Midi off note sent or to be able to manually set in Midi On and Off notes.</p>

<p>The Curves have a user definable length and independent channel settings.</p>

<p>There are 10 channels and they can be chosen and rearranged by editing the PD patch. ideally I’d like a better way to do it but this will work for the moment.</p>

<p>Much testing is still required and I’m sure there will be problems but its there for the moment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So Having had Christmas and new years in short succession I was lucky enough to get quite a bit of time off work.  </p>

<p>Some amount of this was spent celebrating with family and friends but I got to spend a significant amount of it hacking on various projects. The most productive bits of this were spent out of the bedroom and in various pub establishments in Reading town. The upshot is that:-  </p>

<p>The python touch sequencer GUI is coming along nicely, it still looks like gash but at least most of it is working. The pure data back end needs a bit more work and I still need to get Midi CC curves working between the two but I’ve managed to deal with some of the kinks in that already.  </p>

<p>The Go sequencer is back on, kind of. A lot of Saturday and the parts of Sunday where my hangover didn’t hurt, were spent creating Max MSP abstractions and patches to do fun effects. I’ve realised that I happen to have a 5.1 surround sound speaker set kicking about and the idea of doing a 4 channel, crazy noise installation piece is pretty tempting. I might even be able to find somewhere to show it off.  </p>

<p>I was also lucky enough to get hold of some new hardware (well close enough). An old Akai S5000 sampler on the way from eBay which, most importantly, comes with a USB card so there will be no SCSI involvement. Secondly, a Linksys wireless router and a wireless access point. The idea now seems to be to create a rack mounted, linux server that runs the Pure Data patches and just uses a wireless network to communicate with the touch book.  </p>

<p>And after all that, I even managed to spend some time greatly improving the granular synth patch i made in Max. I think its the best example of how my skills are improving. I’ll be putting it up on the Git Hub soon.  </p>

<p>Keep watching  </p>

<p>Guy  </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Indeed I now have Git Hub repositories set up for a few of the projects and it is really nice and usable.</p>

<p>The Touch Sequencer is up on there as well as a simpler Python based OSC touch interface and the final load of NDS Sequencer code. The NDS sequencer isn’t being worked on but may be at some point.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I’ve now wrangled with Python enough to get stuff working. PyGame is installed on the touchbook (a horrible learning process similar to the hassle involved with getting Pure Data working) and I have working python scripts putting up a GUI and running quite happily.</p>

<p>They’re not the best programmed or designed pieces of coding but they work. The touchbook can communicate via OSC over my home network with a variety of MaxMSP and Pure Data patches. I’m now contemplating forgetting the blue-tooth Midi interface and just getting a rack mounted Mini ITX based linux server which will set up and run both a WIFI network and the Pure Data patches. It’s a bit more expensive and moving a bit away from the “Only Music Hardware in the Racks” ethos….. but it looks to be somewhat easier and realistically give me a bit more grunt with which to play on the musical side of things.</p>

<p>Regardless of this I’m planning on setting up a Git Hub account to put all the python sketches on the net for people to use. I’ll research this evening in-between coding and eating and once that’s done I may get round to a bit more self publicising.</p>

<p>Huzza,</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Python is fun and easy, Pure Data is vast and complex, GUI design is not as difficult as it could be, OSC is as of yet untouched but looks to be very usable.</p>

<p>All these things are gradually coming together and I suspect that by the time Sunday evening rolls around I’ll have a working prototype on the touchbook. Once that’s together it’ll be a case of working out any issues, getting my arty girlfriend to make the GUI look nice and then making the wireless MIDI link.</p>

<p>Hopefully the bluetooth stuff will just behave itself and work, I fear this is unlikely however.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So the realisation that coding C++ on the Touch book was going to be tricky has meant I’ve been looking at better (read as easier) ways to create the sequencer.</p>

<p>Pure data has therefore been decided upon for initial work. The differences from MaxMSP became pretty apparent when I found out about Data Structures and how complex and useful they are. A little bit of work and understanding later and it’s all falling into place. Tonight I should be able to have a working abstraction to create multiple drum sequencer tracks.</p>

<p>One other thought that has occurred to me is that whilst Pure Data is good for all this, the GUI really leaves a lot to be desired. With this in mind my plan will be to just create the data structures and sequencing in PD and have these be accessible via OSC, then to create an OSC based GUI in something like pyGame.</p>

<p>Interesting times afoot I reckon</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It seems that creating your own cross compiling tool chain is somewhat tricky, especially if you’re Windows based. It also seems that sometimes you’re better of not trying to deal with the heavy stuff and getting bogged down in technical details. To shorten this lesson down, don’t try to be more clever than you need to be when other people have kindly done it for you.</p>

<p>To this end, I have put on hold the idea of porting the DS Seq code to the Touch book. I still need to release the code for the sequencer since I feel that it was actually a reasonably decent piece of work, I might get it out every now and then again.</p>

<p>Instead, in a revelation that I must thank my friend Ben for, I realised that actually if all I want to do is control drum machines and synths via MIDI, I don’t really have to be so low level about it and so I went looking for something a bit friendlier.</p>

<p>I have found that there is a version of Pure Data that has been modified specifically to work on Non-Floating point type processors such as the ARM chips found in iPods, many mobile phones, PDAs and mostly importantly, the Touch book. It is aptly titled Pure Data Anywhere (PDa) and can be found here http://pd-anywhere.sourceforge.net/</p>

<p>The process of getting it working was none too easy and I’m finding that this seems to be a pretty regular thing with Linux. Thanks to a bug that exists between the version of Tk that is in the Angstrom Package repository (version 8.4) and the version of XWindows on the touch book (version unsure currently but reasonably new) I wasn’t able to get things to run.</p>

<p>Best part of two days later and having compiled and installed the newest versions of TCL and Tk from source (a learning experience) as well as the newest PDa and all is working.</p>

<p>Now I just need to learn how to use this crazy cousin of Max….</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well currently I’m trying to work out the easiest way to port the code from the DS Seq to the touchbook. That’s the big project for the moment, along with all the other musical activities I seem to have. Essentially the DS specific stuff in the code consists of the timers and the graphics.</p>

<p>Everything else is fairly well abstracted so should just invole some slight rewriting to make it bigger and better. C++ is C++ after all and I actually feel I put the concepts of Object Orientated programming into practise pretty well.</p>

<p>The timers and graphics are a problem tho….</p>

<p>The DS has nice interrupt timers that are very accurate and very fast. I could have a timer running at 2000Hz plus and it would do exactly what I wanted. Turns out that normal computers don’t do that and I’m going to be having to do Real Time Clock shenanigans. Should be reasonably easy however. Again, the timers were abstracted well enough that I just need to trigger a single command. The timing itself is just a small, all be it vital, part.</p>

<p>The graphics was always going to be a bigger challenge. So far SDL looks like the best candidate, it’s not too tricky, it,s multi platform, the touchbook comes with the libs (perhaps not all but its still a good sign) and it seems to be the most like the DS graphics layout that I’ve found so far.</p>

<p>So the next plan is to get learning. Oh and also sort out a git hub/google code repository for this. I figure if I just open it up from the start then it will make working on it from anywhere that much easier.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So the day has finally come where the touchbook has arrived.  </p>

<p>That won’t really mean anything to anybody reading this, but then I’ve not exactly been updating this blog at all. Ultimatelly what it means is that the project is now back on. I have to port the NDS Sequencer code to a 1024 * 600 touch screen on a linux powered ARM device. I’m realising that GUI stuff is actually going to be hilariously tricky.  </p>

<p>Ah well, I have plenty to learn heh</p>

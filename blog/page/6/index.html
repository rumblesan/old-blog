  <div class="entry-content"><p>A friend of mine has recently taken the leap into modular synths and I’m just a tad jelous.</p>

<p>Interestingly he’s decided to go down the route of getting a <a href="http://www.expert-sleepers.co.uk/hardware.html">CV interface that connects up to the SPDIF output</a> on his soundcard, prefering to go down the route of sequencing everything from Ableton instead of using hardware sequencers. Certainly I can see the appeal but, unsurprisingly perhaps, I’m most interested in all the intricate, generative stuff you could get done with a large modular system.</p>

<p>I’m still thinking of taking the dive myself and turfing out furniture to make way for an ever growing collection of modules and if I eventually do, top of my list will be the <a href="http://www.makenoisemusic.com/RENE.html">René from MakeNoise</a>. Its an interesting piece of kit that bills itself as a Cartesian Sequencer. Essentially you have a 4 by 4 grid and by sending trigger pulses to it the position will move along the x or y axis. There are various modes and other things it will do but that’s pretty much the crux of it. For a pretty excellent example of what you can do with this, Richard Devine <a href="http://vimeo.com/17350265">makes some fine noise</a> using one as the brains of a reasonably sized setup.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I’ve not actually got the hardware, so I’ll do the next best thing and build something similar in Pure Data.</p>

<p>My take on things will be a tad different but the core principle is still going to be having an X/Y grid and sequencing points on there in a non linear fashion. I built the beginnings of it over the weekend and the code is on GitHub as always. The project is called <a href="https://github.com/rumblesan/PDRene">PDRene</a> because I’m unoriginal.</p>

<p>So here’s a pretty basic patch that gives us somewhere to start from.</p>

<p><img src="/a/2011-10-11-imitation-flattery-and-modular-synths/pdrene_basic.png" alt="Basic PDRene patch" /></p>

<p>A quick rundown of the four sections.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The grid of numboxes have been given send and receive names in the form of $0-x-y-in and $0-x-y-out, where x and y are their coordinates starting from 0. So for example, the num with a value of 6 above is $0-1-2. these all send to receive objects in the gridvals subpatch.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The gridvals subpatch just collects the output from the numboxes and prefixes their coordinates onto them. The change objects make sure that new coordinates are only output for the x and y values when they change.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The until loop and divide/modulus section on the left is just there to fill the grid with numbers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The two counters on the right are used to step through the grid, changing the x or y values as we need.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Nothing too big or clever, the gridvals patch needs to be improved if we’re to expand this to bigger grids but it’s a good starting point. The output is designed so that you can have two complimentary sequences running at the same time, one taking the x vals, the other taking the y vals. This is how some of the output from the Rene works and it’s a pretty good idea.</p>

<p>The next step I’m taking from this is a way to create long running sequences on this. Instead of doing this by sequencing the values themselves, I’ve decided to have a go at sequencing pairs of values that modify the current position. So if we pick the sequence :-</p>

<p>$ [1,1], [2,-1], [3,3] $</p>

<p>assume that we start at position $ (0,0) $ and that we wrap values (a value of 4 wraps to 0, a vlaue of -1 wraps to 3) then by adding the modifier values onto our current coordinates we get the following sequence :-</p>

<p>$ (0,0), (1,1), (3,0), (2,3) $</p>

<p>Here’s the UI of the sequencer, I’ll detail the internals in another post.</p>

<p><img src="/a/2011-10-11-imitation-flattery-and-modular-synths/pdrene_diff_seq.png" alt="PDRene Diff Sequencer ver 1" /></p>

<p>This actually expands on the above idea slightly. There are 4 possible pairs of diff values in a sequence and it’s possible to choose how many pairs the sequence runs through before repeating and how many times each of the pairs will be used at each step. So here for example, we have a sequence length of three, the first pair has a length of 2, the next of three and the third of three. The diff sequence output in one iteration would be :-</p>

<p>$ [1,2], [1,2], [-2,3], [-2,3], [-2,3], [3,-2], [3,-2], [3,-2] $</p>

<p>so starting from $ [0,0] $ our positions would be :-</p>

<p>$ (0,0), (1,2), (2,0), (0,3), (2,2), (0,1), (3,3), (2,1), (1,3) $</p>

<p>This seems to be a pretty interesting way to generate patterns but I want to do some more investigating. I’ll write up another post that quickly details the insides of this sequencer and then move onto some possible uses for this.</p>

<p>I think I’m going to use this to warm myself up to doing another Patch-a-Day month. It’s coming up to a year since the last one and I think it warrants doing again. Better get back into the swing of things</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I’ve put together an album/EP looking thing and stuck it on Bandcamp. This was done using the mass of hardware sitting on my coffee table all in one sitting a few nights ago. It’s three tracks containing just over 30 minutes of ambient/industrial/noise and I hope that someone at least likes it.</p>

<p><img src="http://rumblesan.bandcamp.com/album/live-from-the-palace-of-flies" alt="Live From the Palace of Flies Cover" /></p>

<p>Free to download though you can pay if you think it’s worth it.</p>

<p>Enjoy</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At the moment there’s not a huge amount going on. Quite specifically there’s been next to no Pure Data. Which is a bit sad, but I’m filling my time with other projects and music. In no specific order..</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Updating the render <a href="https://github.com/rumblesan/ClusterRay">farm script</a> I wrote to use new interesting things (<a href="http://www.zeromq.org/">ZeroMQ </a>is Voodoo I tell you!!)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Improving my PHP skills by writing a basic MVC framework</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Practising for an actual gig for real people I have in a couple of weeks</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tidying up my flat</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other sundry socialising type activities</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It’s not necessarily the most thrilling stuff but it’s keeping me busy and meaning that I’m not doing that much audio programming currently. These things ebb and flow so I’m not too worried. I’m pretty sure some thoughts will crystallise soon enough and I’ll be patching again.</p>

<p>Keep an eye open</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Maybe finding effort is actually the issue, either way, my fault.</p>

<p>PatchWerk Radio is up and running, but the site still needs the old stuff putting back on it. Part of the delay for doing that is that I’m rewriting the code base and so won’t be doing the “How Does It Work” blurb until after that’s done.</p>

<p>I haven’t been posting on here mostly because I’ve just been concentrating on actually making music for a bit. I have more Pure Data stuff sorta, kinda maybe in the pipeline but at the moment I’m a slave to Ableton. Good for the soul, bad for maintaining a blog heh. I’ll point you over to my <a href="http://soundcloud.com/tasteforreality">SoundCloud</a> incase you want to hear the fruits of my labour.</p>

<p>One of the things I’m wanting to start looking into is the idea of Design Patterns within PD. Every other language has it’s examples of MVC frameworks and the like, I’m sure there are examples of elegant design patterns in PD that will make life easier. I just need to think it through for a bit.</p>

<p>Anyway, tonight has involved lots of knob tweaking, filter screaming, acid making and I’m going to get back to it now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some of you may have noticed that the Patchwerk Radio site is currently down. OneNode, the people I rent the VPS from, have said this is due to the combination of a data centre outage and a DDOS attack. Sounds like they’re not having a great time of it right now.</p>

<p>When things return to normal I’ll make sure to get Patchwerk Radio back online, I’ve still been feeling fairly uncreative recently so it’s been a bit tricky to get myself to do anything other than eat chocolate and play Minecraft. I am slowly getting back into the swing of things and there will be more noisey goodness happening soon.</p>

<p>Updates on Patchwerk Radio will happen as and when I get them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently the creative juices haven’t been flowing so much, which is a pity but I suppose it happens sometimes. As much as I would love to be constantly artistic and full of ideas, it just doesn’t always happen.</p>

<p>The Pure Data based Launchpad sequencer is still moving along gradually. There are a few issues with the communication between PD and the controller that I need to work out but it’s at least sequencing things and making sounds. There are a few bits in Ableton I’ve been working on but not with any real seriousness. A not inconsiderable amount of my time has been taken up by playing through “Beyond Good and Evil” and “The Ball”, both of which are pretty good.</p>

<p>I’ve got something else forming in the back of my mind that’s actually a Processing project, fluid dynamics with WiiMotes and other shenanigans. Proving a bit tricky to nail down right now but I reckon that I’ll get there. Perhaps a change of direction will do me some good.</p>

<p>Anyway, family to visit, evil to vanquish, zombies to squash etc etc</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>PatchWerk Radio has more fulfilled all my expectations now. It’s up and running, it’s stable, there are some really talented people contributing to it and it seems to have some number of regular listeners. The other night I sorted out a download and stats page for all the patches and there’s a page listing all the contributors as well which finishes all the major functionality stuff I wanted to do. I’ve got plenty of other ideas, and there are some rough edges in the code that need cleaning up, but for the moment I’m quite content to leave it as it is and just get back to writing patches for it.</p>

<p>So I suppose the question is “What now?”.</p>

<p>Well…..</p>

<p>…… hows about a modular sequencing and live performance environment built in PD and for use with the Novation Launchpad?</p>

<p>Sounds pretty good to me which is why I’ve already started it. I realise that there are already plenty of things like this about for the Monome, and certainly quite a few of the ideas I’ll be using will be inspired by some of the excellent software those guys are creating, but I think that the Launchpads extra buttons and multiple colours could really add something to it. As well as that I like the idea of having a fairly generic control framework into which multiple tools can be dropped and swapped around without having to recode large sections.</p>

<p>The whole thing is going to be aimed at live use because I want to get back to playing gigs again and be able to do it with something much more like an instrument that I can play and improvise with.</p>

<p>Some amount of code is already written and I’ll be chucking it up onto a GitHub repo eventually but it’s still very much a work in progress.</p>

<p>As well as this I’m still going to be writing patches for PatchWerk Radio, and churning out music through the more standard “DAW + Stuff” route. I think it’s time for a long weekend again really.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It seems that there was (perhaps still is) a bug that causes the Python process controlling PureData to crash out. PD will keep running but because all the new patch choosing and cross-fading is controlled by python it will then just keep playing the same patch indefinitely.</p>

<p>Initially I suspected it was something to do with updating the META info in the stream when a new patch is loaded but even after turning that off last night it still seemed to be happening. Thankfully the patch seems to have been running fine through last night and after turning proper logging back on (really shouldn’t have turned it off) I think I’ll be ready if it does reveal itself again.</p>

<p>So hopefully anybody who’s been listening has heard at least something they like and want’s to get involved. Just drop me an email if you do.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So PatchWerk Radio continues to keep me busy. Mostly with back-end stuff which, unfortunately, leaves me with less time for patching. Thankfully it’s nearing the point where most of what I want to do with it is done and I can get down to just making noises again.</p>

<p>I’ve got the whole thing integrating with a MySQL database now to give me better logging and various play stats. That’s something I hope to extend but for the moment I’m really concentrating on the front end. I’ve gone with Wordpress again because it saves me from my appalling lack of design skills and it just makes things much easier.</p>

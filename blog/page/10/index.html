  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, as regular readers might have noticed, I am not extending my sampler but am instead doing some synthesis. The reason for this is that I just spent an excellent couple of hours at a friends house making noise and discovered how to get my delay pedal to make string sounds. This reminded me of something called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karplus-Strong_string_synthesis">Karplus-Strong synthesis</a> and when I got home I wanted to try it out in Pure Data.</p>

<p>Turns out it works, really very well, so I decided I’d write it up for tonight since I’ve done it and it’s cool.</p>

<p><img src="/a/2010-11-13-patch-a-day-month-day-12-karplus-strong-strings/12-KarplusStrongString.png" alt="Karplus-Strong String synthesis" /></p>

<p>For something surprisingly basic this does a really good job, the principle behind it is that you have a very short delay with a high feedback and a filter in the feedback loop. You send a brief pulse of noise into the delay chain and the output sounds very much like a string. It turns out that this is actually a pretty good model of how a real string behaves and that there are quite a few variables that can be played with to vary the sound.</p>

<p>With the patch above, there are a number of messages that you can click. When the message is sent into the trigger object a bang is sent out to turn on the noise source and a delayed bang is set up to turn it off. At the same time, the float value sets the output of a signal which in turn sets the delay of the vd~ object. The noise passes into the delwrite~ object and the chain starts itself off.</p>

<p>Changing the feedback will change how long the string sounds for, the filter frequency will change the timbre and the length of the noise pulse will change the attack and timbre characteristics. The eight frequencies I’ve chosen roughly play out a Major scale but they’ve only been tuned by ear.</p>

<p>Have a play around, and read up on the theory on the Wikipedia page if you want to get a good grasp. And if you’re sitting around for a sample player abstraction then I’m afraid you have to wait until tomorrow afternoon when I will get to it. I just thought this was too cool to not talk about.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So today I posted a link to my blog on the <a href="http://puredata.hurleur.com/">Pure Data forum</a> for the purposes of selfless publicity finding other people interested in what I was doing. The response was pretty awesome by my, reasonably small time blogger, standards so to say thank you to those who are visiting and to hopefully keep them coming back for more, I’m finally writing up a bit more about some of my Chaos Theory patches.</p>

<p>On the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chaotic_maps">Big List Of Chaotic Maps</a> that Wikipedia has, the Tinkerbell Map caught my eye pretty much just because of it’s name. It turns out to be pretty easy to implement and use, because its only 2D and the equations are pretty simple.</p>

<p><img src="/a/2010-11-12-using-the-tinkerbell-map-for-chaotic-drones/TinkerBellMap.gif" alt="A 2D plot of the Tinkerbell Map" /></p>

<p>So the first thing to do was to create an abstraction with the equations in. This was a bit easier and neater than for the Lorenz Attractors mostly because there’s less of it but also because the equations themselves don’t get too complex. Also note, I’m trying out the <a href="http://quicklatex.com/">QuickLatex</a> plug-in here for doing my equations, which hopefully looks OK.</p>

<p>$ x_{n+1}=x_n^2-y_n^2+ax_n+by_n $</p>

<p>$ y_{n+1}=2x_ny_n+cx_n+dy_n $</p>

<p>These translate pretty easily into this.</p>

<p><img src="/a/2010-11-12-using-the-tinkerbell-map-for-chaotic-drones/TinkerbellEquations.png" alt="Tinkerbell Map Equation abstraction" /></p>

<p>All the values can be set as creation arguments to make life easier which means that you just need to send a bang in and you get the numbers out. Also having learnt from the Lorenz Equations abstraction just how untidy these things can get I used sends and receives for the feedback. I also added in a reset inlet that just sets the X and Y values back to their original values.</p>

<p>The final patch itself is also pretty simple to look at because all the complex bits are abstracted into here.</p>

<p><img src="/a/2010-11-12-using-the-tinkerbell-map-for-chaotic-drones/TinkerbellsHymn.png" alt="Tinkerbell's Hymn patch" /></p>

<p>I’ve used the simpleFM abstractions again to keep things neat. The output values from the patches get multiplied and then used for the frequency and modulation ratio of the FM voices. In retrospect I think I need to spend a bit more time choosing better ranges for this and I suspect this is where most of the work with this current patch lies but I’m leaving it as something to investigate in future. Each map actually controls two different voices with alternating outputs and the results of these are panned hard left and hard right. The idea is that by giving the two mappings slightly different values, over the time frequencies and timbres of the left and right channel will begin to differ and the stereo field will become wider and more interesting.</p>

<p>The rest of the patch is really just a volume control and recording to a file. The output of this is available on Soundcloud here:-</p>

<p><a href="http://soundcloud.com/tasteforreality/tinkerbells-hymn">http://soundcloud.com/tasteforreality/tinkerbells-hymn</a></p>

<p>[soundcloud]<a href="http://soundcloud.com/tasteforreality/tinkerbells-hymn">http://soundcloud.com/tasteforreality/tinkerbells-hymn</a>[/soundcloud]</p>

<p>The stereo separation happens pretty quickly in this version but I’m guessing that with the correct values this could easily be a piece that takes a long time to evolve if you wanted it to.</p>

<p>The patch can be downloaded from here <a href="/a/2010-11-12-using-the-tinkerbell-map-for-chaotic-drones/TinkerbellsHymn.zip">Tinkerbell’s Hymn Patch</a></p>

<p>The Patch-a-day patch for today will be a bit late. I’m off for an evening of noise with a friend, hopefully this will keep people amused for the moment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So today I’m extending yesterdays patch by adding a few basic controls. Still nothing major but it shows a couple things, speed variation, start offset control and looping. It’s pretty crude so tomorrow I’ll be rebuilding it in a better form, but have a look at what’s here at the moment.</p>

<p><img src="/a/2010-11-11-patch-a-day-month-day-11-a-better-sampler/11-BetterSampler.png" alt="Better Sampler" /></p>

<p>First things first, I’ve changed to a simple line~ object from the vline~ and now whenever the bang is hit it will automatically set the line~ value to go to zero. Makes things a bit easier to use.</p>

<p>The speed control changes the value we give the line as its second argument. Making this time longer or shorter will make the speed faster or slower respectively.</p>

<p>For the start offset we need to do two things, firstly decrease the number of samples played which we do right at the top. Secondly we actually have to increase the sample number that the playback will start from. This is done by adding a signal to the output of the line at the bottom. Tomorrow I’ll go about adding length of playback functionality but I left it out for tonight.</p>

<p>Lastly we have the looping, which is a bit scrappy but works. When the playback time is calculated, we can choose to have this set up a delayed bang by opening or closing the spigot. If we open the gate, the value passes through where it is used to set the length of a delay and then to send a bang into that delay object. The output bang should coincide with the ending of the sample, at which point it will go and start the playback again.</p>

<p>So that’s all for tonight. Tomorrow I’ll try to turn this all into a useful abstraction but now I need sleep.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I started reading up on the Fourier Transform stuff today, and quickly realised that the knowledge I’d learnt at uni had diminished and I was going to have to do a fair bit more reading than I had anticipated. I also realised that to make most of the FFT patches worth while I’d be needing to analyse external sounds so with that in mind, I’m going to be covering sample playback in PureData. Nothing too taxing to start but I need to be asleep in twenty minutes so hopefully this write up won’t take long. As our sample source, I’ve decided on the most sampled sound in existence, the Amen Break, which will feature throughout these examples, even if it will annoy my most loyal reader.</p>

<p><img src="/a/2010-11-10-patch-a-day-month-day-10-a-simple-sampler/10-SimpleSampler.png" alt="Simple Sampler" /></p>

<p>So fairly simple but very useful, the new object of note here is the soundfiler. This takes a couple of arguments and then loads the chosen file into the chosen array. Here we have the file “amen.wav” and we read it into the array “amen” which is displayed in the graph on the left. Once loaded, the soundfiler outputs how many samples long the file is. We can see that this, roughly seven second, segment of music has 307202 samples in it, which we store in the int object.</p>

<p>To play back the samples from the array we use the tabread4~ controlled by a vline~. We want the tapread4~ input signal to go from 0 to 307201 over a specified time. Given that we know that the sample has a sample-rate of 44100Hz we can work out that 307202 / 44100 = 6.966… seconds, we want the time in milliseconds so we just divide by 44.1 instead to get 6966 milliseconds.  This is used to construct a message that sends the vline~ output signal from 0 to 307202 over 6966 milliseconds and then after a further delay of 6966 milliseconds, goes straight back to 0.</p>

<p>Hit the bang and hear the breaks play.</p>

<p>There’s plenty more to do here but I’m tired again so I’ll leave it here for tomorrow.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I’ve extended the patch from last night with a few more sounds and another delay section in the chain. I think I’m going to leave this as it is for now and try to start on something else tomorrow. I’ve also put some audio up on SoundCloud for those that want to hear this and the extended patch is again download-able. This can turn out some quite interesting sounds sometimes and I’m quite pleased with it.</p>

<p><img src="/a/2010-11-09-patch-a-day-month-day-9-more-fun-with-delays/09-MoreDelayFun.png" alt="More Delay Fun" /></p>

<p>The image of the patch is pretty big now so click on it to see everything. I spent some time cleaning it up so it’s a bit easier to follow and figure out.</p>

<p>The bell sounds are pretty much the same as the stuff seen previously, I modified them to have a longer attack and ran them through a low pass filter to take the edge off. The RandBangs and delay objects help to limit the number of bell sounds that get through so the whole thing doesn’t get swamped by them.</p>

<p>The extra delay section is controlled by a very slow LFO which is the combination of two sin waves, the frequencies of which are randomly chosen at the startup of the patch.</p>

<p>Now for the sounds, let’s try the SoundCloud widget again and if that doesn’t work then go to <a href="http://soundcloud.com/tasteforreality/delaycation">http://soundcloud.com/tasteforreality/delaycation</a></p>

<p>Tomorrow I’ve decided I’m going to try and have a play with some of the Fourier transform stuff that Pure Data has. I’ve got a couple ideas to try so it should keep me busy for a few days.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So The other night I started playing with delays in Pure Data but was quickly annoyed because they weren’t working as I was hoping or expecting. Thankfully, when I came to do some reading today it turns out that it was my fault for using the delread~ object when what i actually wanted was the vd~ object. VD here stands for Variable Delay, and what I wanted to do was to start altering the delay speed with some constantly changing signals. I’m baking up something pretty big that I’ll try to have finished soon but for tonight I thought I’d do a brief patch with vd~ and make some noise.</p>

<p><img src="/a/2010-11-08-patch-a-day-month-day-8-fun-with-delays/08-DelayFun.png" alt="Fun with Delays" /></p>

<p>So the hats abstraction makes a reappearance and I’m also using one called blip. This generates clicks and pops by having very short sections of sin waves play, subtle but useful in things like this. These get randomly triggered using the BangRands and a metro. The delay part of the patch is a bit of a mess but revolves around the vd~ and the delwrite~ objects.</p>

<p>The audio gets written to a delay buffer by delwrite~, the vd~ object will read the audio out of it with a delay time based on the signal input to it. This delay time is chosen randomly and changes every so often. When it does the value will smoothly ramp up or down thanks to the line~ which generates some pretty interesting textures and sounds. The sound of the hats and blips are fed to both delays, which are cascaded one into the other.</p>

<p>I want to work some more stuff into here so there are tones and drones as well as the noise. I might try to get to that for tomorrow night. The patch can be found <a href="/a/2010-11-08-patch-a-day-month-day-8-fun-with-delays/08-DelayFun.zip">here</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So the extension from yesterday is pretty simple but it helps round it out quite a bit. I’ve taken some basic drum synthesis patches I’ve made and tacked them on so that now this thing creates rhythms. It’s not great to be honest and it reminds me an awful lot of  the sort of drum sounds and patterns on old Casio keyboards. But it quite happily rolls along, creating a mildly varying pattern with what even sound like drum fills occasionally. This time I’m going to have the patch download-able because I haven’t got time to sort out that GitHub repository yet and there’s enough other stuff here that it makes sense to.</p>

<p><img src="/a/2010-11-07-132/07-GenerativeDrums.png" alt="Generative Drum Sequencer with sounds" /></p>

<p>So same as yesterday really but I’ve tacked on the kick, snare, hat and ‘blip’ objects so I can actually hear what the rhythms are like. The answer is ‘pretty naff’ but It’s a start. The download for the patch is <a href="/a/2010-11-07-132/07-GenerativeDrums.zip">here</a> so go grab it and have a look around. The drum sounds aren’t anything amazing, but I’ll probably have a post going over them soon.</p>

<p>Hooray, It’s Monday tomorrow, I think tomorrow evening I’ll devolve into noise again to celebrate. Come back then.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Back to some sequencing today, no sounds yet with this, I’ll have them tomorrow. This patch is a pretty simple drum sequencer with a bit of randomness in it that should hopefully keep things interesting whilst not being overly complex to modify. One of the things I’m realizing now that I’m trying to do more generative stuff is that randomness is great and all, but it needs to be tempered with a degree of regularity as well, otherwise the results can tend to just be a mess unless you’re lucky. Hopefully I’ll be able to balance the two nicely as I extend this over the next few weeks.</p>

<p><img src="/a/2010-11-06-patch-a-day-month-day-6-generative-drum-sequencer/06-GenerativeSequencer.png" alt="Generative Sequencer" /></p>

<p>The section at the top is the metro and counter as well as a few other bits so that once the counter hits 32 it resets as well as resetting when the metro is restarted. From here the step number is passed to four different sections. Each section will control a different type of drum sound, Kick, Snare, Open and Closet Hi-Hat and then Clave or Cowbell. The select objects are used to determine which beats the sound should be played, with the hat section (third along) the mod object is used so that the sel object’s list doesn’t have to be so big.</p>

<p>The BangRand object is a small abstraction I created just to keep things a bit neater.</p>

<p><img src="/a/2010-11-06-patch-a-day-month-day-6-generative-drum-sequencer/BangRand.png" alt="Bang Rand Abstraction" /></p>

<p>All this has is a rand object that feeds a moses object. The argument of the abstraction sets the divide argument of the moses object so that the choice of output is weighted by it. some of the bangs from the select objects will go straight to the sounds, some are fed through this abstraction to create double hits, delayed hits or alternate sounds for the hat section.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I’ll add in some drum sounds to this. I’ve had the patches already made for a little while and will give a quick intro of how they work later, but tomorrow will just be about getting this making some noise.</p>

<p>See you then</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This patch is a pretty simple one, but it’s a pretty useful one and introduces a couple of new objects and concepts. A user drawable LFO, the idea being that you can draw the shape of the waveform you want in the graph and set the speed of the playback. At the moment it just gives the output to the snapshot object but it can be built into lots of things. I’ll have a go at getting some FM sounds out of it soon but for now, lets keep it simple.</p>

<p><img src="/a/2010-11-05-patch-a-day-month-day-5-user-drawable-lfo/05-DrawableLFO.png" alt="User Drawable LFO" /></p>

<p>So the important part here is the tabread4~ object and the graph. The graph has 100 points in it with values ranging between -1 and 1, the tabread is set up to read the values out of the graph. The phasor~ object will output a value between 0 and 1 which we multiply by 100 so that we can plug it straight into the tabread4~ and it will run through all the elements there. the output of the tabread4~ gets run through some maths so that it ends up going between 0 and 1.</p>

<p>The tabread4~ object has the 4 because its actually using 4-point polynomial interpolation. I’m unsure of the maths involved here but it means that we could actually feed it floats and it would interpolate between the values we’ve drawn for smoother curves. Maybe something for later.</p>

<p>The only other bit of clever stuff is the top where the toggle, trigger, multiple and number objects are combined so that the toggle will turn the LFO on and off and the number box can be used to change the playback frequency whilst the whole thing is running.</p>

<p>Very simple but pretty effective.</p>

<p>Anyway, I’ve been ill today and just want to eat chocolate and read right now so I’m disappearing. Tomorrows post will be earlier than this one as I’m out and about tomorrow evening. Probably going to have to get Sunday’s patch sorted early as well. Better stop moaning and get patching hehe.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So today we actually get Pure Data making some noise at us by combining patches from days two and three. Since that’s not an especially difficult task to complete I’ve extended the whole thing as well with some extra bits to make everything a bit more musical. The problem with our patch is that we don’t actually have any control over what notes are going to be played, just what the interval between them will be. Whilst this makes it easier to have a small number of states have a large range of notes, it doesn’t necessarily make for good music.</p>

<p><img src="/a/2010-11-04-patch-a-day-month-day-4-making-some-tunes/04-MarkovTunes.png" alt="Markov Tunes" /></p>

<p>The first thing to notice is that there’s a pretty big mess of stuff at the bottom of the patch. This is something that should be pretty simple but I’ve not spent time refining it so its ugly. There’s a counter made of a float and an addition object, every time a new interval is chosen this counts up, when sixteen intervals have gone through it closes the gate, blocking the sixteenth choice, resets the note to sixty and the interval change to zero. The note then gets sent out and everything carries on as normal. This way we retain some control over the starting point of the tune that will be played so things don;t go wondering off too much.</p>

<p>The second addition is the scaler subpatch and this is really what makes the whole thing not sound rubbish.</p>

<p><img src="/a/2010-11-04-patch-a-day-month-day-4-making-some-tunes/ScalerPatch.png" alt="Scaler Patch" /></p>

<p>Inside we have two tables, major and minor, which hold interval data for the major and minor scales. The incoming note value gets run through the mod 12 object, the output of this is then used to look up the corresponding value in the chosen table. The mod value is subtracted from the original note value and the new value added on. This way all the notes that come through will only be notes on the A major or Minor scale. To change the key it would be necessary to add a value to the beginning and then subtract this at the end, which I haven’t done yet but will soon. This patch is going to turn up quite a bit from now on.</p>

<p>Finally the output of the scaler patch goes to the mtof object which converts our midi number into a frequency to feed to the synth.</p>

<p>Anyway, ramen time now, I’m hungry. Have fun playing with the patch until tomorrow</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So yeah, no posts for two months, thats pretty rubbish.  </p>

<p>It doesnt help much that blogger is blocked from work but thats still not really a good excuse.  </p>

<p>Anyway, a quick catchup.  </p>

<p>Currently I’m building a step sequencer on the DS with a view to either having MIDI output from it, or having the sounds played back from the DS as well. Right now I’m mostly just grappling with having a sub par understanding of C but its getting better.  </p>

<p>I am still to finish the monome, circuit boards are STILL being designed…….this is pretty weak on my part truth be told but it will get done, and when it does I may well have an NDS based step sequencer to hook it into :P</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have a new place that now has reasonable furniture in it. I have internet. I have a 128 homebrew monome thats in need of some circuitry designed and manufactured.</p>

<p>I also have to wait for Ableton Live 8 and the amazing integration with Max/MSP.</p>

<p>So I’d better finish the monome and learn how to use to sucker now eh?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>but only really in the real world.</p>

<p>Updates here have been light mostly due to my time being diverted into flat hunting and xmas tom-foolery. A new flat has been found and it has plenty of space so that I’ll actually be able to set up permanent work desks for music and for electronics and will still have enough space for a table to eat at that won’t be covered in wires. this is good times I feel.</p>

<p>I’ll be having to hunt for a fair bit of furniture however and I will be without internet access for a good few weeks most likelly so again updates will be stilted. I’m hoping that once things are sorted then there will be regular updates that will be both interesting and useful.</p>

<p>We shall see</p>

<p>Well merry festivities and all. Here’s to the joys of space.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I’d like to say hello and thank you to the people actually reading this now. I’m pretty sure that people are either coming here from the shameless self publication on Facebook, or from the shameless self publication on Hackaday.</p>

<p>Either way, I’m glad people are noticing, but now I don’t have an excuse for not putting any work into this.</p>

<p>In the coming month there may not be a huge amount of technical stuff put up here, which is to say I still plan to post but I’ve recently got myself a new job and so now have half a month to find a new place, organise myself, buy good shirts and trousers and generally get the hell out of home………for the second time since going to uni (seriously kids, organise this stuff before graduating because nothing sucks harder than moving back in with your parents after 2+ years away).</p>

<p>However, I will still post, I will try really hard to keep putting up updates on the Go sequencer as it is something I like and that doesn’t require a huge amount of space or hardware related stuff (any soldering I do currently is done on a small table perched at the edge of my bed, this is neither comfortable or practical). I think for the moment I’ll just work on getting the webcam part sorted so it’s actually a decent interface and spend time later making the wierd, esoteric, matrix-based sequencers.</p>

<p>There were also questions from Joel in the previous posts comments about using this system to track and record actual games of Go. I’m definatelly up for trying this but would probablly move out of Max/MSP and into actual programming. The Hackaday post mentioned about a gumball sequencer very similar to mine that used processing and since that’s something I’ve been wanting to look into I’ll begin investigating.</p>

<p>There is currently also a post of mine saved in the drafts that’s going over the outlines for the Dub Box project. I havn’t put it up yet because I havn’t got the pictures to go with it because I havn’t got the right card reader to work with the old digicam I’ve been given because I’m mostly rubbish……not a good excuse but a fairly valid reason I feel. Never fear, tomorrow, as well as getting a full sized go board with which to continue tweaking said sequencer, I’ll also get hold of said card reader so all and sundry can see how bad my circuit planning diagrams are.</p>

<p>Untill then, good night, I’m going to go hug my ailing and sick girlfriend. What’s the female equivilent of Man-Flu anyone?!?</p>

<p>Guy
(possibly needs a better internet handle)</p>

<p>p.s. I’m currently on her iBook and it feels a little…………disconcerting. I like Apples stuff and do regularly find myself with that constant inkling for a laptop thats nice looking pretty shit hot too boot, but I havn’t yet got used to driving one…….there appears to be no delete key for one thing…….will I just stop making mistakes if I get my own Apple??</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well I meant to put these up yesterday, but so far no one is reading this blog so it doesn’t matter too much at this stage, heh.</p>

<p>As was previously said, the system is currently picking up black and white objects on the wooden board and translating their positions onto a matrix. I’ve built a very basic sequencer section but haven’t gotten round to hooking it up to anything to make noises. one of the unfortunate problems at the moment is that picking up objects at the edge of the field of vision is difficult. For the moment have a look at the screen caps and marvel at how, despite Max 5 having features to make patches look nice, the interface is pretty gash.</p>

<p>Both show the basic interface, top one with object coordinates overlaid over normal web cam feeds, bottom one with monochrome feeds.</p>

<p><a href="http://s461.photobucket.com/albums/qq338/notesandvolts/go%20sequencer/?action=view&amp;current=gosequencernormal.jpg"><img src="http://i461.photobucket.com/albums/qq338/notesandvolts/go%20sequencer/th_gosequencernormal.jpg" alt="Go Sequencer Normal View" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://s461.photobucket.com/albums/qq338/notesandvolts/go%20sequencer/?action=view&amp;current=gosequencerbnw.jpg"><img src="http://i461.photobucket.com/albums/qq338/notesandvolts/go%20sequencer/th_gosequencerbnw.jpg" alt="Go Sequencer Monochrome View" /></a></p>

<p>Currently the setup isn’t especially great and is basically just a web cam taped to a wall above the board…….it’s not even a Go board at the moment. This will all be fixed eventually and I’m currently thinking out how the rig for holding the web cam will work.</p>

<p><a href="http://s461.photobucket.com/albums/qq338/notesandvolts/go%20sequencer/?action=view&amp;current=boardsetup.jpg"><img src="http://i461.photobucket.com/albums/qq338/notesandvolts/go%20sequencer/th_boardsetup.jpg" alt="Current Sequencer Testing Setup" /></a></p>

<p>Part of the problem with the whole thing at the moment is due to the lighting. For this reason the rig will hold some form of decent lighting system as well as the camera.</p>

<p>I’m not sure how well this sequencer could be used live and I’m leaning towards it not really being suitable, but I’m still willing to give it a go and even if the sequencing isn’t great it doesn’t really matter. If the drumming is out of time and the melodies are dissonant I’ll just pass it off as break-core. The whole thing will look awesome anyway.</p>

<p>I might well be putting the patch up once I’ve done a bit more tweaking to this so people can have a play and maybe do this themselves.Will let you know.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So a considerable amount of Friday night and Sunday afternoon was spent playing with the Go sequencer. It’s actually in a reasonable state of working-ness, in-so-much-as I have the camera feeding into Max/MSP/Jitter and using the very excellent CV Jitter externals (<a href="http://www.iamas.ac.jp/%7Ejovan02/cv/">http://www.iamas.ac.jp/~jovan02/cv/</a> go look) I have the patch finding black and white objects on a wooden board and then updating their co-ordinates into a matrix grid.</p>

<p>There are (obviously) a few problems. The web-cam isn’t great as its only a cheapo USB affair and so the grainy-ness of the image leads to coordinates of the objects moving around a bit too much. This can probably be fixed with some amount of calibration and tweaking but I’m not going to do that until I’ve built some sort of proper rig to hold the camera and lighting above the board.</p>

<p>Also, some minor form of movement detection needs to be done so that when I put stones on the board the matrix won’t be updated with coordinates caused by my hand. In fairness I’ll probably use the random data generated by putting my hand in the way for something later, but let’s just get the basics done first, eh?</p>

<p>There will be pictures when I get home (currently on my lunch break, the man has ceased his flogging in order to let me go and get ham sandwiches), as well as some basic design flow diagrams and probably the patch as well.</p>

<p>So far the greatest lesson I have learnt, is that any project that doesn’t require building anything complicated gets reasonable results a lot quicker. Computer Scientists have it easy I tells ya.</p>

<p>Until later</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well I very much doubt that anybody will read this, at least for a while. But if I don’t put anything on here then nobody will ever read it and that’s a pretty sorry state of affairs.</p>

<p>So anyway, this is my blog that’s going to be used as some sort of repository for my projects and interesting things I get up to. My reckoning now is that these will all be music and electronics and programming based but this is open to wild speculation.</p>

<p>Either way, I’m going to try and actually find stuff to update this with regularly, even if its just going to be some cool but ultimately rubbish Max/MSP patch.</p>

<p>To at least wet my non existent crowds appetite I’ll mention a few of my hopefully upcoming projects.</p>

<p>D.I.Y. Arduino based Monome 128
Everybody wants a Monome, there isn’t much to this really and there’s plenty of info on the net but little it seems about building 128 or 256 versions. This is partially done now and is on hold until the case is ready.</p>

<p>A tangible sequencer type thing based on a Go board and web cam
Simple enough idea, get a Go board ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go<em>(game)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go</em>%28game%29) if you don’t know what Go is), a web cam and a laptop. Get the laptop to recognise the Go pieces reliably and hilarious noise may ensue.
This is probably going to be the first thing to start going up as it’s currently in a reasonable state. It’s Max/MSP/Jitter based and is at a reasonable level of “beginning to work”-ness that I’d be happy to start showing it off.</p>

<p>Finally, what will hopefully be a reasonably thorough look at designing a reggae dub siren. This is a project for a friend who wants something to make funny wobbly dub sounds. The basic circuit is not too taxing but I’m hoping to make this a little more complicated, LFO modulation on filters and delay. Should give me a chance to put my teaching hat on and badly explain electronics.</p>

<p>So enough for now, I’ll try and get something up by the middle of next week, and start this ball rolling. For any information about me, you’ll have to wait until I decide what I want to say about myself and update my profile.</p>

<p>Ta Ta For Now</p>

<p>Guy</p>

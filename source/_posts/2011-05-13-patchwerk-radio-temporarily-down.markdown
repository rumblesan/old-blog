Some of you may have noticed that the Patchwerk Radio site is currently down. OneNode, the people I rent the VPS from, have said this is due to the combination of a data centre outage and a DDOS attack. Sounds like they're not having a great time of it right now.

When things return to normal I'll make sure to get Patchwerk Radio back online, I've still been feeling fairly uncreative recently so it's been a bit tricky to get myself to do anything other than eat chocolate and play Minecraft. I am slowly getting back into the swing of things and there will be more noisey goodness happening soon.

Updates on Patchwerk Radio will happen as and when I get them.

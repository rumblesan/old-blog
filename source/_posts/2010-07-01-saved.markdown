So I almost actually deleted this whole thing the other night.

I wasn't too sure that I actually wanted another blog seeing as the other one had fallen by the wayside so much. But the realisation that that was partly down to my not doing any interesting projects currently, and also because Blogger is partially blocked from work. Enough so that making posts isn't possible without using the email posting functionality, and that's a bit annoying.

Also, the knowledge that my Boss was reading at points didn't do much to help.

I'm planning to use this space not only to disseminate my brand of noise, but also to talk about some of the techniques and processes I use and create.  Having my own hosted space on which I can put Max/MSP patches and the like for download will be pretty helpful.

Anyway, tonight I have to finish off a remix for a friend that's long overdue, but I'll try and squeeze in a post about something interesting. Possibly a first foray into Granular Synthesis in SuperCollider, a subject I've been looking for an excuse to cover for a while.

Until Later, hopefully

Guy

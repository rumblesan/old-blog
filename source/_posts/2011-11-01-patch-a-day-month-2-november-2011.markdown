So it's now a year since the last patch-a-day month and I think it's necessary to do this again. I've got some ideas for a few things I really want to do and this would be a good way of just getting them done. As well as that, I realise that I need to write more patches for PatchWerk Radio. I'm still fixing up bits on the back-end but the actual patches haven't changed for a bit, probably because it seems like I haven't been doing anything with it.

Anyway, I'm going to get a smallish patch sorted for tonight, I'm planning on spending this week going over some of the design patterns I've started using in Pure Data. Might not be the most interesting stuff but it's all useful. If you're really after cool, algorithmic patches then don't worry, there'll still be plenty of those.

Right, nose to the grind stone, lets get this party started!

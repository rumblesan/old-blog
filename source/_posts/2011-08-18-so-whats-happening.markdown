At the moment there's not a huge amount going on. Quite specifically there's been next to no Pure Data. Which is a bit sad, but I'm filling my time with other projects and music. In no specific order..

  * Updating the render [farm script](https://github.com/rumblesan/ClusterRay) I wrote to use new interesting things ([ZeroMQ ](http://www.zeromq.org/)is Voodoo I tell you!!)

  * Improving my PHP skills by writing a basic MVC framework

  * Practising for an actual gig for real people I have in a couple of weeks

  * Tidying up my flat

  * Other sundry socialising type activities

It's not necessarily the most thrilling stuff but it's keeping me busy and meaning that I'm not doing that much audio programming currently. These things ebb and flow so I'm not too worried. I'm pretty sure some thoughts will crystallise soon enough and I'll be patching again.

Keep an eye open

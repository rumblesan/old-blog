So the touch sequencer is finally at that point where I feel it's ready to release. Obviously it's been available all this time but now I'm actually going to start poking people about it.

The GUI is still ugly, but that should just take an evening with Paint Shop Pro and a few "How to make nice buttons" tutorials off the web.

So, a brief feature run down

Both CC Curve and Grid channels

Grids come in 8*16 and 16*32 flavours.
Each can be configured to have an automatic Midi off note sent or to be able to manually set in Midi On and Off notes.

The Curves have a user definable length and independent channel settings.

There are 10 channels and they can be chosen and rearranged by editing the PD patch. ideally I'd like a better way to do it but this will work for the moment.

Much testing is still required and I'm sure there will be problems but its there for the moment.

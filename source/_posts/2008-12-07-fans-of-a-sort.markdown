So I'd like to say hello and thank you to the people actually reading this now. I'm pretty sure that people are either coming here from the shameless self publication on Facebook, or from the shameless self publication on Hackaday.

Either way, I'm glad people are noticing, but now I don't have an excuse for not putting any work into this.

In the coming month there may not be a huge amount of technical stuff put up here, which is to say I still plan to post but I've recently got myself a new job and so now have half a month to find a new place, organise myself, buy good shirts and trousers and generally get the hell out of home.........for the second time since going to uni (seriously kids, organise this stuff before graduating because nothing sucks harder than moving back in with your parents after 2+ years away).

However, I will still post, I will try really hard to keep putting up updates on the Go sequencer as it is something I like and that doesn't require a huge amount of space or hardware related stuff (any soldering I do currently is done on a small table perched at the edge of my bed, this is neither comfortable or practical). I think for the moment I'll just work on getting the webcam part sorted so it's actually a decent interface and spend time later making the wierd, esoteric, matrix-based sequencers.

There were also questions from Joel in the previous posts comments about using this system to track and record actual games of Go. I'm definatelly up for trying this but would probablly move out of Max/MSP and into actual programming. The Hackaday post mentioned about a gumball sequencer very similar to mine that used processing and since that's something I've been wanting to look into I'll begin investigating.

There is currently also a post of mine saved in the drafts that's going over the outlines for the Dub Box project. I havn't put it up yet because I havn't got the pictures to go with it because I havn't got the right card reader to work with the old digicam I've been given because I'm mostly rubbish......not a good excuse but a fairly valid reason I feel. Never fear, tomorrow, as well as getting a full sized go board with which to continue tweaking said sequencer, I'll also get hold of said card reader so all and sundry can see how bad my circuit planning diagrams are.

Untill then, good night, I'm going to go hug my ailing and sick girlfriend. What's the female equivilent of Man-Flu anyone?!?

(possibly needs a better internet handle)

p.s. I'm currently on her iBook and it feels a little............disconcerting. I like Apples stuff and do regularly find myself with that constant inkling for a laptop thats nice looking pretty shit hot too boot, but I havn't yet got used to driving one.......there appears to be no delete key for one thing.......will I just stop making mistakes if I get my own Apple??

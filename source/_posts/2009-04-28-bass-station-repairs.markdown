So it turns out that the Bass Station had a dodgy potentiometer for the frequency control of the filter, a fairly important control. Makes me a sad panda, espescially when it turns out that getting hold of a replacement pot is particularly tricky.

 

 

After alot of searching I found that there are alot of potentiometers that "almost" fit the bill, but because each of them comes in a multitude of versions with different knob lengths (teehee), styles, with and without bushings and not to mention different values of course,  could not get an exact match.

 

 

In retrospect, all I'll have to do is some surgery with a hacksaw and a craft knife and it's not too much hassle. Just mildly annoying.

 

At least I'm able to fix it, otherwise it would really suck.

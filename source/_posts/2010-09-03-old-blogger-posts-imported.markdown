So I decided to move all my posts from my old and slightly defunct Blogger account over to this here WordPress. It will fill in a bit of back story on the NDS sequencer and some of my other past projects.

I'll be going through the posts gradually and re-tagging them to make it a bit easier to search through.

Edit: I'm also going to need to fix the code examples on some of the old posts, will try to do it over the weekend.

So Having had Christmas and new years in short succession I was lucky enough to get quite a bit of time off work.  
  
Some amount of this was spent celebrating with family and friends but I got to spend a significant amount of it hacking on various projects. The most productive bits of this were spent out of the bedroom and in various pub establishments in Reading town. The upshot is that:-  
  
The python touch sequencer GUI is coming along nicely, it still looks like gash but at least most of it is working. The pure data back end needs a bit more work and I still need to get Midi CC curves working between the two but I've managed to deal with some of the kinks in that already.  
  
The Go sequencer is back on, kind of. A lot of Saturday and the parts of Sunday where my hangover didn't hurt, were spent creating Max MSP abstractions and patches to do fun effects. I've realised that I happen to have a 5.1 surround sound speaker set kicking about and the idea of doing a 4 channel, crazy noise installation piece is pretty tempting. I might even be able to find somewhere to show it off.  
  
I was also lucky enough to get hold of some new hardware (well close enough). An old Akai S5000 sampler on the way from eBay which, most importantly, comes with a USB card so there will be no SCSI involvement. Secondly, a Linksys wireless router and a wireless access point. The idea now seems to be to create a rack mounted, linux server that runs the Pure Data patches and just uses a wireless network to communicate with the touch book.  
  
And after all that, I even managed to spend some time greatly improving the granular synth patch i made in Max. I think its the best example of how my skills are improving. I'll be putting it up on the Git Hub soon.  
  
Keep watching

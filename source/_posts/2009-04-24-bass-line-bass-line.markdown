So I've now paid for and received a Novation Bass Station from a very friendly chap on eBay.







This thing is lots of fun. Lots of knob tweaking, squelch making, bass vibrating, booty shaking fun.







I'm going to grab a couple cheapish rack mount synths and samplers I think. And then I just need to finish the DS Grid Sequencer........I'll have to come up with a better name for it than that.







On that front actually, I've gotten a fair bit of the DSBrut/DSMI integration work done, the whole thing should be finished soon. I'm still cleaning up the code for SeqGrid and I'm pretty sure I have all the necessary know how to do the MIDI CC output stuff.







Good times all around

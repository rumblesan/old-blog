Maybe finding effort is actually the issue, either way, my fault.

PatchWerk Radio is up and running, but the site still needs the old stuff putting back on it. Part of the delay for doing that is that I'm rewriting the code base and so won't be doing the "How Does It Work" blurb until after that's done.

I haven't been posting on here mostly because I've just been concentrating on actually making music for a bit. I have more Pure Data stuff sorta, kinda maybe in the pipeline but at the moment I'm a slave to Ableton. Good for the soul, bad for maintaining a blog heh. I'll point you over to my [SoundCloud](http://soundcloud.com/tasteforreality) incase you want to hear the fruits of my labour.

One of the things I'm wanting to start looking into is the idea of Design Patterns within PD. Every other language has it's examples of MVC frameworks and the like, I'm sure there are examples of elegant design patterns in PD that will make life easier. I just need to think it through for a bit.

Anyway, tonight has involved lots of knob tweaking, filter screaming, acid making and I'm going to get back to it now.

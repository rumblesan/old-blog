So in an effort to actually keep me regularly posting I think I'm going to use this place more as a repository for my general ideas. I've found that it's possible to update blogger via email so I will be able to put stuff up here from work so instead of coming home with a backpack full of "post it" notes I'll just be able to check here  
  
In other news, the DS sequencer is pretty much working. I'll try to add MIDI output tonight and once that's done i can hook it up to stuff for noises. Code will be released at some point to. Happy Happy Joy Joy

So I've now wrangled with Python enough to get stuff working. PyGame is installed on the touchbook (a horrible learning process similar to the hassle involved with getting Pure Data working) and I have working python scripts putting up a GUI and running quite happily.

They're not the best programmed or designed pieces of coding but they work. The touchbook can communicate via OSC over my home network with a variety of MaxMSP and Pure Data patches. I'm now contemplating forgetting the blue-tooth Midi interface and just getting a rack mounted Mini ITX based linux server which will set up and run both a WIFI network and the Pure Data patches. It's a bit more expensive and moving a bit away from the "Only Music Hardware in the Racks" ethos..... but it looks to be somewhat easier and realistically give me a bit more grunt with which to play on the musical side of things.

Regardless of this I'm planning on setting up a Git Hub account to put all the python sketches on the net for people to use. I'll research this evening in-between coding and eating and once that's done I may get round to a bit more self publicising.

Huzza,

Guy

So for a while I've had an idea about writing a sequencer based on [Befunge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Befunge). The main mechanics being a moving pointer that affects and is effected by the tiles you place on a two dimensional grid.

I'm going to have a go at knocking up a proof of concept in the next couple days, I suspect that processing will be the language of choice for the task and that initially it will only support MIDI and OSC. I do have more plans for it but a working system will be fine for the moment.

More to come on this soon...

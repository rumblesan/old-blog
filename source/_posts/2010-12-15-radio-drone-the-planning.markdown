For quite a while I've had the idea of making an internet radio station that just plays generative music. By this, I don't mean a station that has a playback of generative music songs, but instead one that plays the output of generative music and noise patches and just keeps streaming them over the internet.

A while ago I found out that at one point this was being done, but r4nd.org seems to have been defunct some time ago and I don't think there's anything like this currently around.Â With the ability to easily rent reasonable VPS servers and the cheapness of bandwidth I'm pretty confident that getting something like this off the ground shouldn't be especially taxing.

It's just a matter of building all the patches.......

So for that reason I've decided that, beginning in the new year, I'm going to create two new patches every week until such a time as I feel I have enough. Since I tend to be better when I set myself definitive goals, I'm going to be doing this for at least three months. At the same time I'll build the framework for a system that will be able to dynamically load and unload PD patches and cross fade between streams.

That actually sounds like a pretty good new years resolution to me.

So a short, quick post about customising my octopress install. As has been pointed out in a few places on the internet, Octopress is great but people have a tendancy to keep the defaults once they've got everything running. Whilst it's a really good theme, it's not that great if your blog looks like everybody elses.

So using a base custom colors.scss file from [Zachary Maril](http://zacharymaril.com/blog/2012/02/24/please-please-octopress/) and a style.scss file from [Alessandro Melandri](http://melandri.net/2012/02/14/octopress-theme-customization/) I was able to rejig Rumblesan into something a little different. Pobablly a few things that need further tweaking, but it's looking good already.

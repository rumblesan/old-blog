I have literally just managed to get a basic test version of Radio Drone (I really need a better name) working!!

I've been running it on a VPS I've got from [onenode.net](http://www.onenode.net/) and despite my initial worries about whether a VPS could deal with realtime synthesis from PD, everything works pretty much fine. It's late here and I want to go to sleep now but I will be updating when I next get a chance with some of the ins and outs and the hurdles I've jumped so far.

Needless to say, I'm feeling pretty good about this all now

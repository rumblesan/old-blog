Well I meant to put these up yesterday, but so far no one is reading this blog so it doesn't matter too much at this stage, heh.

As was previously said, the system is currently picking up black and white objects on the wooden board and translating their positions onto a matrix. I've built a very basic sequencer section but haven't gotten round to hooking it up to anything to make noises. one of the unfortunate problems at the moment is that picking up objects at the edge of the field of vision is difficult. For the moment have a look at the screen caps and marvel at how, despite Max 5 having features to make patches look nice, the interface is pretty gash.

Both show the basic interface, top one with object coordinates overlaid over normal web cam feeds, bottom one with monochrome feeds.

Currently the setup isn't especially great and is basically just a web cam taped to a wall above the board.......it's not even a Go board at the moment. This will all be fixed eventually and I'm currently thinking out how the rig for holding the web cam will work.

Part of the problem with the whole thing at the moment is due to the lighting. For this reason the rig will hold some form of decent lighting system as well as the camera.

I'm not sure how well this sequencer could be used live and I'm leaning towards it not really being suitable, but I'm still willing to give it a go and even if the sequencing isn't great it doesn't really matter. If the drumming is out of time and the melodies are dissonant I'll just pass it off as break-core. The whole thing will look awesome anyway.

I might well be putting the patch up once I've done a bit more tweaking to this so people can have a play and maybe do this themselves.Will let you know.

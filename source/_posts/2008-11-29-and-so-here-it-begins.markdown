Well I very much doubt that anybody will read this, at least for a while. But if I don't put anything on here then nobody will ever read it and that's a pretty sorry state of affairs.

So anyway, this is my blog that's going to be used as some sort of repository for my projects and interesting things I get up to. My reckoning now is that these will all be music and electronics and programming based but this is open to wild speculation.

Either way, I'm going to try and actually find stuff to update this with regularly, even if its just going to be some cool but ultimately rubbish Max/MSP patch.

To at least wet my non existent crowds appetite I'll mention a few of my hopefully upcoming projects.

D.I.Y. Arduino based Monome 128
Everybody wants a Monome, there isn't much to this really and there's plenty of info on the net but little it seems about building 128 or 256 versions. This is partially done now and is on hold until the case is ready.

A tangible sequencer type thing based on a Go board and web cam
Simple enough idea, get a Go board ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28game%29) if you don't know what Go is), a web cam and a laptop. Get the laptop to recognise the Go pieces reliably and hilarious noise may ensue.
This is probably going to be the first thing to start going up as it's currently in a reasonable state. It's Max/MSP/Jitter based and is at a reasonable level of "beginning to work"-ness that I'd be happy to start showing it off.

Finally, what will hopefully be a reasonably thorough look at designing a reggae dub siren. This is a project for a friend who wants something to make funny wobbly dub sounds. The basic circuit is not too taxing but I'm hoping to make this a little more complicated, LFO modulation on filters and delay. Should give me a chance to put my teaching hat on and badly explain electronics.




So enough for now, I'll try and get something up by the middle of next week, and start this ball rolling. For any information about me, you'll have to wait until I decide what I want to say about myself and update my profile.


Ta Ta For Now

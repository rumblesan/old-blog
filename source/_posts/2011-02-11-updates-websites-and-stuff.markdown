So PatchWerk Radio continues to keep me busy. Mostly with back-end stuff which, unfortunately, leaves me with less time for patching. Thankfully it's nearing the point where most of what I want to do with it is done and I can get down to just making noises again.

I've got the whole thing integrating with a MySQL database now to give me better logging and various play stats. That's something I hope to extend but for the moment I'm really concentrating on the front end. I've gone with Wordpress again because it saves me from my appalling lack of design skills and it just makes things much easier.

Head over to [radio.rumblesan.com](http://radio.rumblesan.com) to have a look.

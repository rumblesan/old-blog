The last two weeks have basically been a break from PureData to concentrate more on some of the other things I enjoy doing. The rhythmic noise album in 12 days plan hasn't emerged Â quite as well as I had hoped so will remain on the workbench for a little while longer. I have successfully ported the generative beats patch to Max4Live and have extended it some more, there's still plenty of work that needs to go into it and I'm not entirely sure that what I've done has made it better but I expect this to be a long term thing so it's not a worry.

What I have started doing for most of today is playing around with processing to make interesting shapes again. More importantly I've gone and had a play with the POV-Ray exporting code from [Dave Bollinger](http://www.davebollinger.com/works/p5povray/) (who makes some very cool art) and I can now prototype scenes in Processing and then export the basics to POV-Ray. I've started putting up pictures on my Flickr profile which I'm sure I'll find some natty, web2.0 way to link to this site.

Next week will hopefully feature some more PD, probably with more extensions to the granular synth tho perhaps also with some cool PD plus Processing visuals. Depends on how I feel.

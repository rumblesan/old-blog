How unsurprising that my blog has fallen by the wayside a little.  
  
As far as updates go, things have been moving along.  
  
I have now moved house and am living with a friend of mine,not only does this halve my rent but he's a good cook and an engineer to boot.  
  
The DS Sequencer has had improvements:-  
  
The ability to act as a MIDI sync master has been added but not yet tested.  
I've created tracks with grid sizes 16 * 32. Squares are a little small but still usable.  
The main home page is getting a redesign so I can have 8 tracks easily on it and still have space for menus/BPM stuff.  
  
There are still some things I'd like to do but for the moment it's only really the front page redesign that's getting in the way of releasing it.  
  
As far as the audio hardware goes, I'm eyeing up a 12U rack case to put stuff in, Gear right now totals 7U so I'll have plenty of space to expand.  
I'm also eagerly awaiting the DSBrut guys finishing the Blue tooth cart. I'll be wanting to make a decent wireless MIDI connection then. Wires are so 2003

The other night I finally got to sit down with Processing and work out some ideas. The results were pretty cool I feel.

There will probably be some PovRay renders of this scene, maybe even some animations.

EDIT: Hmm, seems that my pages don't stretch correctly and this is messing with the layout a bit. I'll leave this here for the moment, because at least then people will see it, but I do reckon that I need to do something about the layout soon. something to do over christmas time.

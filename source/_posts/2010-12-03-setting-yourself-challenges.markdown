I'm finding that all these "Do X in Y days" challenges are pretty good for getting myself to do stuff. Currently I have twelve days to make six rhythmic noise tracks and find someone to release it. It'll be a net label of some sort but I just like the idea of making something very harsh and very heavy, and also of actually having something of mine released.

I've ported the generative beat maker into a Max for Live patch so I'm using that in Live at the moment and it will be used pretty extensively for this project. It's far too much fun just to let it keep going but it needs more work. Mentally I'm building a list of what I'd like it to do next with it. Some new features will be aimed for live use, some for just helping to make better beats.

So by next Sunday, I should have something that I feel is a complete project to shout about. Watch this space I suppose.

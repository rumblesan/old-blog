PatchWerk Radio has more fulfilled all my expectations now. It's up and running, it's stable, there are some really talented people contributing to it and it seems to have some number of regular listeners. The other night I sorted out a download and stats page for all the patches and there's a page listing all the contributors as well which finishes all the major functionality stuff I wanted to do. I've got plenty of other ideas, and there are some rough edges in the code that need cleaning up, but for the moment I'm quite content to leave it as it is and just get back to writing patches for it.

So I suppose the question is "What now?".

Well.....

...... hows about a modular sequencing and live performance environment built in PD and for use with the Novation Launchpad?

Sounds pretty good to me which is why I've already started it. I realise that there are already plenty of things like this about for the Monome, and certainly quite a few of the ideas I'll be using will be inspired by some of the excellent software those guys are creating, but I think that the Launchpads extra buttons and multiple colours could really add something to it.Â As well as that I like the idea of having a fairly generic control framework into which multiple tools can be dropped and swapped around without having to recode large sections.

The whole thing is going to be aimed at live use because I want to get back to playing gigs again and be able to do it with something much more like an instrument that I can play and improvise with.

Some amount of code is already written and I'll be chucking it up onto a GitHub repo eventually but it's still very much a work in progress.

As well as this I'm still going to be writing patches for PatchWerk Radio, and churning out music through the more standard "DAW + Stuff" route. I think it's time for a long weekend again really.

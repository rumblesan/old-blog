There's been a bit of a change to the site, which hopefully people will have noticed. I'm now using the excellent [Octopress](http://octopress.org) and hosting everything on github. The comments have been moved over to [Disqus](http://disqus.com) and should all be migrated soon.

What this means for me is that

* I don't pay dreamhost for my hosting
* It's easier to integrate stuff from github
* I get to write all my posts in markdown
* I get to use Vim for everything

In other words, good times. There's still a few things I need to sort out but hopefully I'll have them done in the next couple of days.

So the day has finally come where the touchbook has arrived.  
  
That won't really mean anything to anybody reading this, but then I've not exactly been updating this blog at all. Ultimatelly what it means is that the project is now back on. I have to port the NDS Sequencer code to a 1024 * 600 touch screen on a linux powered ARM device. I'm realising that GUI stuff is actually going to be hilariously tricky.  
  
Ah well, I have plenty to learn heh

Have some drums! A full, working drum sequencer patch, borrowing liberally from the excellent rjlib for a decent drum synth and hooking it up to the Euclidean sequencers we've made.

I modified the sequencers a bit more so they contain their own controls, makes the whole thing look a bit better and makes it easier to patch. The clock is primitive but functional and the sounds are minimal but suitable. I'm going to leave it at this for the Euclidean stuff, I'm pretty chuffed that I managed to get it all working in vanilla PD but it's time to move on. Tomorrow night I have a spare evening so I'm going to concentrate on the data structures and should be able to catch up the days I owe. You can grab the patches from the repository, or here's a download instead. Happy tweaking

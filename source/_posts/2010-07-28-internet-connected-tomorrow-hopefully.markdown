So This has been dead for a week or two now. Mostly due to my moving into a new place and internet taking a while to sort. This is a pretty weak excuse but is hassle-some enough that it got in the way.

Next week once its all working and I've finished the next post I'll get back to updating.

Hold tight

Guy

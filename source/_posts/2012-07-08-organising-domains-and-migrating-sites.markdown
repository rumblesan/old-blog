So after having succesfully migrated my main Wordpress over to Octopress I'm not in the process of changing the PatchWerk Radio site to use a jekyll based site hosted on github. having a full blog for it was a bit overkill and really it's just a handful of static pages.

I started with [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) and then created my own theme for it that essentially mimics the old look of the PatchWerk site. A few moments of confusion as to how to use liquid tags but it's all up and running now. The new site is up at [http://rumblesan.com/PatchWerk-Radio/](http://rumblesan.com/PatchWerk-Radio/) and hopefully it will use the old [http://patchwerk.rumblesan.com](http://patchwerk.rumblesan.com) domain as soon as I have the DNS settings all sorted.

The Author, Patch and Currently Playing info will all also be available with the plan being to create an api on the server that can deal with JSONP. Gives me an excuse to learn something new.

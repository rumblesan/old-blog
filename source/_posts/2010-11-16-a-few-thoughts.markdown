So I've definitely decided that saving this blog was a pretty good idea. The patch-a-day month has forced me to keep up the writing side of things so far and as well as being good for my PureData skills, that's just been good for getting me to do stuff. Otherwise I suspect Minecraft and BioShock would have soaked up a considerable number of my evenings by now. I've been having a couple of thoughts about all this and figure I should put them down here.

1. The layout of this site was always meant to be minimal. This is because I like minimal designs, but also because I lack the skills necessary to make something that doesn't look ugly. I am thinking that the page design might be _too _minimal however, so I'm going to try and do something about it.

2. I have my GitHub account and the badge in the corner proudly displays what I have on there. I do need to use it a bit more, specifically for putting up PD and SuperCollider patches so that people can grab them.

3. Visitor numbers are something I have only a vague sense of, doubly so with feed numbers. I'm planning on getting around to doing the Google Analytics and Feedburner stats tracking stuff because whilst the standard wordpress stats are ok, I'd like to know a bit more. Incidentally, if you are reading this, feel free to ask questions and send me emails.

4. Someone has come back to me in the comments saying that videos of some of the PD patches would be welcome. I'll see what I can do about this as it's a pretty good idea and I need to put my Vimeo account to better use.

5. I want to do more stuff with OSC and having multiple programs and hardware communication to each other. I've got a bit of know-how with Processing and I've made projects using PyGame on a Linux tablet talking to Pure Data so I should carry on combining them.

That's probably all for the moment but there will probably be more in future. I'll try to get started on some of this stuff soon.

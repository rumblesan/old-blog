Last weekend I was bumbling about town and happened to go into one of the Oxfam bookshops. After perusing the fiction section i found that they had a section entirely devoted to engineering, only 2 shelves worth but the content was amazing.  
  
I've ended up grabbing a copy of the General Electronics Transistor Manual. The 7th edition, published in 1964 and it's frankly amazing. It has just about all the information i could possibly want to know about transistors, right from all the basics of biasing through to filters and oscillators.  
  
Needless to say I'm pretty chuffed with it. For 4 pounds I think I got a bargain.

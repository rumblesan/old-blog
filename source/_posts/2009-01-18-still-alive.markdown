I have a new place that now has reasonable furniture in it. I have internet. I have a 128 homebrew monome thats in need of some circuitry designed and manufactured.

I also have to wait for Ableton Live 8 and the amazing integration with Max/MSP.

So I'd better finish the monome and learn how to use to sucker now eh?

but only really in the real world.

Updates here have been light mostly due to my time being diverted into flat hunting and xmas tom-foolery. A new flat has been found and it has plenty of space so that I'll actually be able to set up permanent work desks for music and for electronics and will still have enough space for a table to eat at that won't be covered in wires. this is good times I feel.

I'll be having to hunt for a fair bit of furniture however and I will be without internet access for a good few weeks most likelly so again updates will be stilted. I'm hoping that once things are sorted then there will be regular updates that will be both interesting and useful.

We shall see

Well merry festivities and all. Here's to the joys of space.

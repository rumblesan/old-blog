Indeed I now have Git Hub repositories set up for a few of the projects and it is really nice and usable.

The Touch Sequencer is up on there as well as a simpler Python based OSC touch interface and the final load of NDS Sequencer code. The NDS sequencer isn't being worked on but may be at some point.

Everything can now be found here, [http://github.com/rumblesan](http://github.com/rumblesan)

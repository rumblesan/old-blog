So even with having a net book with which to work while I'm on the train, I still don't seem to have enough hours in the day.







I'll list all the stuff that still needs doing here, partly as a matter of interest, but more in an effort to get me to do something about it all.








	
  1. I've recently agreed to help the DS Homebrew community along by adding support for the DSBrut serial cart to the DS Midi Interface library.

	
  2. I've discovered that it should be easily within my grasp to add drawable Midi CC curves to my sequencer. Obviously this means I now have to do it.

	
  3. I need to find out if it's possible to use the SCSI to IDE interface I bought from eBay to get a SCSI SD card reader working, and if that can then be used to connect to my sampler.

	
  4. Somewhere along the line I need to build the dub siren I promised to a friend

	
  5. And finish the circuit boards for my monome128

	
  6. Alot of the electronics junk around my house can probably go to a cash converters, giving me space and money.

	
  7. The taxman owes me cash money actually...........quite alot of cash money. I should ask him for that back soon

	
  8. I have a little under 2 months now to find a house to move into. This will also involve packing and tidying just abotu everything in the current place (Letting Agency instructions state that amongst other things, I am to clean fingerprints off the light switches and door handles)

	
  9. These things all fit around that whole socialising thing. Man friends are a time sink.




The reality is that a handful of these need nothing more than a phone call and some letter writing, or a quick trip out the front door. Others require a whole lot more planning unfortunately.







I'd better start doing more work on the train.

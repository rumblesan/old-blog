Recently the creative juices haven't been flowing so much, which is a pity but I suppose it happens sometimes. As much as I would love to be constantly artistic and full of ideas, it just doesn't always happen.

The Pure Data based Launchpad sequencer is still moving along gradually. There are a few issues with the communication between PD and the controller that I need to work out but it's at least sequencing things and making sounds. There are a few bits in Ableton I've been working on but not with any real seriousness. A not inconsiderable amount of my time has been taken up by playing through "Beyond Good and Evil" and "The Ball", both of which are pretty good.

I've got something else forming in the back of my mind that's actually a Processing project, fluid dynamics with WiiMotes and other shenanigans. Proving a bit tricky to nail down right now but I reckon that I'll get there. Perhaps a change of direction will do me some good.

Anyway, family to visit, evil to vanquish, zombies to squash etc etc

Moving house is potentially a lot of hassle and effort, but usually alright. Except when you weren't organised enough to sort out the internet before you moved in..... Then it becomes a serious inconvenience.
Everything will get sorted in a week or so but updates may be even more sporadic than they have been.
The good news is that I've thought of something new to keep me busy and entertained with Pure Data. More on that in a week

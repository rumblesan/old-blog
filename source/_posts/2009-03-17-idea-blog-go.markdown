Ok,  
  
so lets say I have a rangefinder of some sort, I'm assuming ultrasound.  
  
This is attached to the top of a tripod.  
  
There are sensors on the tripod that can detect the up/down and left/right angle that the rangefinder would be pointing at, lets say in an arc 140 degrees total on both axes.  
  
So then I have an interface to a computer (altho I reckon it could be done without one) that has a canvas 140 by 140 pixels, and depending on what value the range finder picks up at a particular vertical/horazontal angle the pixel is a certain colour.  
  
Now, if the tripod could be controlled via servos, and depending on what the range finder picked up, the aim would move, creating some sort of crazy feedback path.  
  
And then there's the question of what the image would look like.  
  
There's a few things that would need working out. Putting a static object infront of it would make it pretty useless to have the feedback loop unless this was controlling something else, probablly noise/music related.  
  
Moving objects infront of it could prove interesting. I suppose it depends on how quickly it could scan really.  
  
  
I'll sit the idea here for the moment anyway

One of the things I've always been interested in is the idea of algorithmic, generative music. I think it's stemmed from a love of complex, glitchy music but wanting to be able to create it live instead of just replaying loops or sections and this is still something I struggle with now.

I think I'm going to start expanding this blog somewhat based on this. Initially I was just going to be using it as a place to post SuperCollider stuff as I learnt more about the program, but that itself just seems to be a small part of the whole.

So, here is my plan. Each week I will come up with an idea, build an example of it, learn about it, try and explain my thoughts about it and post up the code for anybody to use. Sometimes I might be expanding on a previous idea, sometimes I will try and come up with something new, sometimes I might just wholesale take someone else's idea and try to modify it in my own way or maybe just learn about it. I am also going to try and have a weekly post on a SuperCollider, PureData or Max/MSP lesson. Looking back at the previous SuperCollider stuff I'm already seeing mistakes so these might only be of use to me but so be it.

As a heads up, I can say that the first example is going to be based on Markov Chains, since I've already spent some time playing about with them and I want to investigate them more.

Hopefully I'll be able to get hat and an SC lesson done by the end of the weekend.

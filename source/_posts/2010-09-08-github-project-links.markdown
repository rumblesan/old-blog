So if you look in the sidebar on the right, you should now see a nice set of links to my Github repositories. Most of it now is now NDS related code but there's a reasonable amount of python in there.

Eventually there will be some SuperCollider projects to be found but I still have plenty of learning to do before its anything other than the code examples from the site so far.

Feel free to have a browse.

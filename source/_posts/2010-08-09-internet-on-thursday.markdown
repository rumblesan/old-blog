So the initial estimates were wrong and apparently my Internet will be returned to me on Thursday. Until then all I have is access at work and that's not quite sufficient.

As soon as Thursday evening rolls around , however, the post on control buses should go live. I've learnt quite a bit about them, mostly thanks to reading the very good docs (My opinion of the SC docs is changing quite substantially now) so there should be plenty to look forward to.

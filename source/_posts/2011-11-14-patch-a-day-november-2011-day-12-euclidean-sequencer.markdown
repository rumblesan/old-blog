So here's the abstraction for a single Euclidean sequencer. Give it a number of beats and the length of the measure and it will create your pattern. Feed it bangs and it will give you out more bangs in the right sequence. There's even the ability to change the phase of the sequence or reset it with a simple bang.

I'm afraid I haven't been able to get as much done as I'd hoped, once you're behind it's difficult to get back on target but I'll make sure I catch up soon. Anyway, this should keep you all amused for a little while. The abstraction can be downloaded from the git repository and should be just a matter of drop and go.

Enjoy

So I've put together an album/EP looking thing and stuck it on Bandcamp. This was done using the mass of hardware sitting on my coffee table all in one sitting a few nights ago. It's three tracks containing just over 30 minutes of ambient/industrial/noise and I hope that someone at least likes it.

![Live From the Palace of Flies Cover](http://rumblesan.bandcamp.com/album/live-from-the-palace-of-flies)

Free to download though you can pay if you think it's worth it.

Enjoy

Unfortunately die to technical difficulties and prior engagements (OS update and beer festival) I'm going to be unable to patch until Sunday.  

I'll aim to get everything done and written up by then and I'll come up with something else interesting to make up for the delay.  

The lesson here is to make sure you have enough posts stored up incase of emergency, and not to reinstall ubuntu on the laptop used for patching when away from home, only to find you can't get pd installed.  

At least my weekend will be fun.

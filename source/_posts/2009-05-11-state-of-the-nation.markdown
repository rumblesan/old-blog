Or more specifically, the DS Sequencer.  
  
Things are good on all fronts.  
  
Working MIDI output....Check  
Variable length grid based step sequencer....Check  
Drawable MIDI CC patterns with variable length....Check  
  
Usable and nice looking user interface....kinda....enough....CHECK  
  
The code is not terribly neat but it works. Currently MIDI output can be a bit laggy if there are lots of messages being sent but I think I know why that is. The CC tracks may not be as efficient as they could be.  
  
Ultimately, its almost done, and I have a gig in just under two weeks where I want to demo it. The bank of equipment now includes two hardware synths as well as a sampler and more will come in time.  
  
Expect pictures/code/video within the month....or at least that's the plan.

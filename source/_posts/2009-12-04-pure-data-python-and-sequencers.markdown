Python is fun and easy, Pure Data is vast and complex, GUI design is not as difficult as it could be, OSC is as of yet untouched but looks to be very usable.

All these things are gradually coming together and I suspect that by the time Sunday evening rolls around I'll have a working prototype on the touchbook. Once that's together it'll be a case of working out any issues, getting my arty girlfriend to make the GUI look nice and then making the wireless MIDI link.

Hopefully the bluetooth stuff will just behave itself and work, I fear this is unlikely however.

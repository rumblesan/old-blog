So a second additing to the auto updating [Tumblr](http://rumblesan.tumblr.com) is now live.

[Cuttr](https://github.com/rumblesan/cuttr) is written in scala and will apply randomised (but hopefully interesting) mathematically defined processes to the RGB values of an image.

Usual, *found on Tumblr, shown on Tumblr* rules apply.

I'm planning on adding a few more glitching possibilities to it but the early results are already pretty promising. Much of the time with this was actually spend wrestling with the OAuth stuff, made significantly easier due to the [Scribe](https://github.com/fernandezpablo85/scribe-java) library. Also, I still don't quite get reading of binary data in Scala. Should be easy, but never seems to be.

Anyway enjoy the results

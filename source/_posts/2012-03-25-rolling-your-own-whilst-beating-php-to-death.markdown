So I'm going to be starting a new job soon and one of the many things I'm looking forward to is never having to write PHP again. I want to make a conscious effort to remove it from my life and that means Wordpress is going to go.

Now, I know that PHP isn't quite as bad as some people make out, it's certainly got its flaws and can be a bit of a pig sometimes, but if you don't do anything stupid or obtuse then it does the job and does it without too many problems. My reason for moving is just that I want to put it totally behing me. There's plenty of much more interesting, powerful and fun things I could be doing, and if I want to learn more about them then starting fresh feels like the best way to go about it.

So, what are these new shiny things I want to play with. The short answer is [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/). It's one of the languages I'll be using in my new job and it looks pretty cool. The longer answer is [Scalatra](http://www.scalatra.org/), [Jetty](http://jetty.codehaus.org/), [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) and a host of other web tech which I'll be using to rewrite this blog from the ground up.

Keep watching I guess

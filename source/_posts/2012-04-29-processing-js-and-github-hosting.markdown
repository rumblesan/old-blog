So Processing.JS is pretty cool, this much we know. GitHub is also pretty cool, I don't think anybody is going to deny that either.

It turns out that the two work really, really well together and because of this I decided to throw up a gallery of my Processing.JS sketches that's hosted using githubs pages.

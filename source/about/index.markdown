I'm Guy and I am an engineer of varying sorts these days.

Rumble-San Heavy Noise Industries is a place where I'll post up my discoveries, inventions, lessons and thoughts to do with algorithmic composition and audio programming. I'll also gradually put up music I've made, most of which will be heavily noise based.

If you want to get in contact with me then either leave a comment or email **contact** atÂ **rumblesan.com**
